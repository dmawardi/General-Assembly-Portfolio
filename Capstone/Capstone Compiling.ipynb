    "We will import the exported data from the first section of the project, where we collected all our data, to prepare it for EDA and modelling.\n",

    "Data collection and cleaning has been split into parts 1 and 2, in order to provide an opportunity to revisit the topic in future.  We have attempted to simplify our problem by collapsing our timeseries information in this part. If in future we wish to model the timeseries information, we can simply start from this point with all of the previous year information still available.\n",
