# General-Assembly-Portfolio
**Welcome to my General Assembly Portfolio!**

Enclosed are 5 projects that were completed during the 12-week Data Science Immersive at General Assembly.

Each of the projects vary on scope dependent on the skills that were being learnt at the time.  You will find that the packages and methods used for each are quite diverse.


**Project 1: Pokemon**
-Use of Python loops and data structures to create the framework for a Pokemon game
-Python Dictionaries and lists were used to store Pokemon and Player information

**Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis**
-Project 2 was split into 2 parts: Student SAT/Verbal Score analysis & Drug Use Data analysis
-Pandas was used to manipulate/explore data and Matplotlib/Seaborn was used to graph distributions and relationships
-Drug data was used to formulate a hypothesis test in regards to correlations between the frequency of use and overall usage of different drugs

**Project 3: Modelling Housing Data**
-Use of SKLearn machine learning and regression models in order to predict housing prices

**Project 4: Scraping Jobs Data**
-Use of Selenium, Requests, and Scrapy packages to scrape job advertisements from job website Seek. Data was used to predict salary and classify whether jobs were for senior / junior positions

**Capstone Project: GDP & Quality of Life:**
-Combination of previously learned skills to assess whether a viable model to predict GDP could be built. 
-Through a performing model, we were able to gain insight into the variables that have the most impact on GDP per capita, and thus, ascertain actionable recommendations.
